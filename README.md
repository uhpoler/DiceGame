# DiceGame

This is a DiceGame for two players, I created it for practicing DOM and Events fundamentals.

- When a player clicks the 'ROLL' button, the game rolls a dice, generating a number between 1 and 6.
- Each roll adds to the player's 'CURRENT' score.
- When the player presses the 'HOLD' button, all current points are transferred to the 'SCORE' section.
- The first player to reach 100 points wins the game.

WARNING: If a player rolls a '1', all their current points are lost, and the next player takes their turn.
